# **RAINSTORM**

### Real & Artificial Intelligence for Neuroscience ‚Äì Simple Tracker for Object Recognition Memory

**A complete toolkit for analyzing rodent exploratory behavior in object recognition tasks.**

![RAINSTORM Logo](examples/images/logo.png)

**RAINSTORM** is a Python-based tool for scoring exploratory behavior in rodents üê≠. It takes pose-estimation data (e.g., from DeepLabCut) and provides a full workflow to process, analyze, and visualize recognition memory performance, from manual labeling to AI-powered automation.

## Installation üíæ

### Prerequisites

First, ensure you have the following software installed on your system.

* [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html) (or Anaconda)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> [!TIP]
> During the Miniconda installation, it is recommended to select the option to **add Conda to your system's PATH**. This will make it easier to run `conda` commands from any terminal.
> Make sure to reboot your computer to ensure the new software is properly installed.

### Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open a terminal (or Miniconda Prompt) and run the following command.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sdhers/rainstorm.git](https://github.com/sdhers/rainstorm.git)
    ```
    This will create a `rainstorm` folder in your current directory.

2.  **Set Up the Conda Environment**
    Navigate into the cloned directory and create the dedicated environment from the provided file:
    ```bash
    cd rainstorm
    conda env create -f rainstorm_venv.yml
    ```
    Once the environment is ready, you can activate it by running `conda activate rainstorm`.

3.  **Launch VS Code & Select Kernel**
    Launch VS Code from the terminal:
    ```bash
    code .
    ```
    In VS Code, ensure the Python extension is installed:
    * Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
    * Search for "Python" and install the official extension from Microsoft.

    Open a Jupyter notebook (e.g., `2a-Prepare_positions.ipynb`).
    * When prompted to select a kernel, choose the `rainstorm` Conda environment from the list of `Python Environments`.

You are all set! You can now run the notebooks to explore the RAINSTORM workflow.

## Usage üíª

RAINSTORM offers two main functionalities: a full analysis pipeline using Jupyter notebooks and a standalone tool for manual video labeling.

-----

### Video Handling üé•

We offer a quick and easy way to prepare videos for pose estimation and behavioral analysis.

**Open the file `0-Video_handling.ipynb`**
1.  **Run the Video Handling app**
    This app allows you to:
    * Trim the video to the desired length.
    * Crop the video to the desired size.
    * Align videos based on two manually selected points (very useful when batch processing videos with ROIs).
2.  **Run the Draw ROIs app**
    This app allows you to:
    * Draw ROIs and points on the video.
    * Select a distance for scaling.

-----

### RAINSTORM Behavioral Labeler ‚úçÔ∏è

For precise, frame-by-frame annotation, use the **RAINSTORM Behavioral Labeler**.

**Open and run the file `1-Behavioral_labeler.ipynb`**
1.  **Select the video you want to label.**

2.  **(Optional) Load a previous labeling `.csv` file.**
    * This allows you to pick up where you left off.

3.  **Select the behaviors to label and their keys.**
    * Enter the behaviors you want to score (e.g., `exp_1`, `exp_2`, `freezing`, `grooming`, etc...).

> [!WARNING]
> Keys should be unique, single characters, and different from the fixed control keys: (Quit: `q`, Zoom In: `+`, Zoom Out: `-`, Margin Toggle: `m`)

4.  **Start Labeling!**
    After pressing 'Start Labeling', the video will load, and you can begin annotating frame by frame using the keys you defined.

### The RAINSTORM Pipeline üî¨

The core of this project is a series of Jupyter notebooks designed to guide you from raw data to final results.

-----

#### `2a-Prepare_positions.ipynb`

üßπ **Process and clean bodypart position data.**

* Filters out frames with low tracking likelihood from DeepLabCut.
* Interpolates and smooths data to correct glitches.
* **Output:** Clean `.csv` files ready for analysis.

![1-Prepare_positions](examples/images/1-Prepare_positions.png)

-----

#### `2b-Geometric_analysis.ipynb`

üìê **Perform geometric labeling of exploration and freezing.**

* Applies a simple geometric rule for exploration:
    * Distance to object < `2.5 cm`
    * Angle towards object < `45¬∞`
* Identifies freezing behavior based on lack of movement.

![2-Geometric_analysis](examples/images/2-Geometric_analysis.png)

-----

#### `3a-Create_Models.ipynb`

‚öôÔ∏è **Train AI models for automatic behavioral labeling.**

* Uses your manually labeled data to train TensorFlow models.
    ![4-Evaluate_models_b](examples/images/4-Evaluate_models_b.png)
* Includes an LSTM network (a **wide** model) that considers temporal sequences for higher accuracy.
    ![3-Create_Models](examples/images/3-Create_models.png)
* Evaluates model performance against human labelers using Principal Components Analysis (PCA).
    ![4-Evaluate_models_a](examples/images/4-Evaluate_models_a.png)

-----

#### `3b-Automatic_analysis.ipynb`

üß† **Automate labeling with your trained AI model.**

* Applies your best-performing model to label unseen datasets.
* Generates comparative visualizations (like polar graphs) to contrast manual, geometric, and AI-driven labels.

![6-Compare_Labels](examples/images/6-Compare_labels.png)

-----

#### `4-Seize_Labels.ipynb`

üìä **Extract, summarize, and visualize your final data.**

* Calculates key metrics like the Discrimination Index.
* Generates publication-ready plots to compare behavior across different experimental groups and sessions.
