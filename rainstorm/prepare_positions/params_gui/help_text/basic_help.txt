Basic Setup & Processing Parameters

EXPERIMENT SETUP:
• path: Path to the experiment folder containing the pose estimation files
• software: Software used to generate the pose estimation files ('DLC' or 'SLEAP')
• fps: Video frames per second
• filenames: Pose estimation filenames
• bodyparts: Tracked bodyparts

PARAMETERS FOR PREPROCESSING POSITIONS:
• confidence: How many std_dev away from the mean the points likelihood can be without being erased (it is similar to asking 'how good is your tracking?')
• median_filter: Number of frames to use for the median filter (it must be an odd number)
• near_dist: Maximum distance (in cm) between two connected bodyparts. In c57 mice, I use half a tail length (around 4.5 cm).
• far_dist: Maximum distance (in cm) between any two bodyparts. In c57 mice, I use whole body length (around 14 cm).
• max_outlier_connections: If a bodypart has more than this number of long connections, it will be dropped from the frame.

EXPERIMENT DESIGN:
• targets: Exploration targets
• trials: If your experiment has multiple trials, list the trial names here
• target_roles: State the roles targets can take on each trial (e.g., 'Hab': None, 'TR': ['left', 'right'], 'TS': ['novel', 'known'])
