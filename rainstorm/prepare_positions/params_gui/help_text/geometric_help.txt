Geometric Analysis Parameters

REGIONS OF INTEREST:
• roi_data: Loaded from ROIs.json
• frame_shape: Shape of the video frames ([width, height])
• scale: Scale of the video in px/cm
• rectangles: Rectangular areas in the frames
• circles: Circular areas in the frames
• points: Key points within the frames

TARGET EXPLORATION:
• distance: Maximum nose-target distance to consider exploration
• orientation: Set up orientation analysis
• degree: Maximum head-target orientation angle to consider exploration (in degrees)
• front: Ending bodypart of the orientation line
• pivot: Starting bodypart of the orientation line

OTHER BEHAVIORS:
• freezing_threshold: Movement threshold to consider freezing, computed as the mean std of all body parts over a time window
• freezing_time_window: Time window in seconds for calculating immobility (how long to look around)
